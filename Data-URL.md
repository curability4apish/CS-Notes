The URL format you provided is known as a **data URL** (or **data URI**). Specifically, it is a way to include small data items inline in web pages as if they were external resources. 

### Breakdown of the Data URL:

1. **Prefix**: The URL starts with `data:`, which indicates that the following content is a data URL.

2. **MIME Type**: After the `data:` prefix, there is a MIME type, in this case, `image/png`, which specifies the type of data being included. This tells the browser that the data is a PNG image.

3. **Encoding**: The `base64` part indicates that the data is encoded in Base64. This is a method of encoding binary data (like images) into ASCII characters, which can be easily included in text-based formats like HTML or CSS.

4. **Data**: The long string that follows is the actual Base64-encoded data of the image. This string represents the binary data of the PNG image.

### Usage:
Data URLs are often used in web development to embed images directly into HTML or CSS, which can reduce the number of HTTP requests needed to load a page. However, they are best suited for small images or icons, as larger images can significantly increase the size of the HTML or CSS file, potentially impacting performance.

### Example:
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how a data URL might be used in an HTML `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Embedded Image" />
```

### Conclusion
In summary, the URL you provided is a data URL that embeds a Base64-encoded PNG image directly into the HTML or CSS, allowing for inline representation of the image without needing a separate file.
